# Fix for Multi-Level Tool Call Execution

## Critical Problem Identified
The extension had a fundamental flaw in tool call handling that prevented it from completing multi-step conversations with the AI:

### Previous Behavior (Broken)
1. ✅ User asks: "Read all files in hello_mod"
2. ✅ AI responds: "I'll call `list_files` tool"
3. ✅ System executes `list_files` and sends results back
4. ✅ AI responds: "Now I'll call `read_file` tool to read each file"
5. ❌ **System stops here** - doesn't execute the second tool call
6. ❌ No final answer provided to user

### Root Cause
The `handleToolCalls` method only processed **one level** of tool calls. When the AI made additional tool calls in follow-up responses, the system didn't continue the conversation loop.

## Solution Implemented

### New Behavior (Fixed)
The system now implements a **conversation loop** that continues until the AI provides a final response without tool calls:

```typescript
while (currentMessage.tool_calls && currentMessage.tool_calls.length > 0 && iterationCount < maxIterations) {
  // Execute tools
  // Send results back to AI
  // Get next response (which may contain more tool calls)
  // Continue loop if needed
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Iterative Tool Execution**: Continues executing tools until AI provides final answer
2. **Safety Limits**: Maximum 10 iterations to prevent infinite loops
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Each iteration is logged with context `tool-follow-up-1`, `tool-follow-up-2`, etc.
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling at each iteration level
5. **Intermediate Messages**: All intermediate tool calls are logged and stored

### Expected Flow Now
1. ✅ User asks: "Read all files in hello_mod"
2. ✅ AI responds: "I'll call `list_files` tool" (INITIAL)
3. ✅ System executes `list_files` → sends results back
4. ✅ AI responds: "Now I'll call `read_file` tool" (TOOL-FOLLOW-UP-1)
5. ✅ System executes `read_file` → sends results back
6. ✅ AI responds: "Based on the files, here's the summary..." (FINAL ANSWER)

### Log Structure
The raw JSON logs will now show:
- `CONTEXT: INITIAL` - First request
- `CONTEXT: TOOL-FOLLOW-UP-1` - First tool follow-up
- `CONTEXT: TOOL-FOLLOW-UP-2` - Second tool follow-up (if needed)
- etc.

### Safety Features
- **Iteration Limit**: Stops after 10 iterations to prevent infinite loops
- **Error Recovery**: If any iteration fails, the process stops gracefully
- **Complete Logging**: Every request/response is logged for debugging

## Impact
This fix resolves the core functionality issue where the AI assistant would start tool execution but never complete complex multi-step tasks, leaving users without final answers.
